# Sector Location
Nestled in the galactic disk of Centaurus A (NGC 5128/Caldwell 77), Loki's Reach is found 13.1 kpc from the galactic center.

# Summary
This sector was formerly the home of [SA Military HQ]({% link "station/sam-hq" %}) and the center of the [Star Alliance]({% link "faction/star-alliance" %}) jurisdiction. When [The Rift]({% link "event/the-rift" %}) annihilated the military base along with the systems around it, the [members]({% link "faction/star-alliance/members" %}) of the alliance fragmented and an exodus began. Loyal members attempted to salvage the alliance, but their efforts proved futile as the SA disintegrated over the following year.
