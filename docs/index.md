# Location
Nestled in the galactic disk of Centaurus A (NGC 5128/Caldwell 77), Loki's Reach is found 13.1 kpc from the galactic center.

# History
This sector was formerly the home of {% include utils/linker.htmf text="SA Military HQ" href="station/sam-hq" %} and the center of the {% include utils/linker.htmf text="Star Alliance" href="faction/star-alliance" %} jurisdiction. When {% include utils/linker.htmf text="The Rift" dir="event" %} annihilated the military base along with the systems around it, the {% include utils/linker.htmf text="members" path="faction/star-alliance#members" %} of the alliance fragmented and an exodus began. {% include utils/linker.htmf text="Loyal members" href="faction/star-alliance#remaining-members" %} attempted to salvage the alliance, but their efforts proved futile as the SA disintegrated over the following year.
