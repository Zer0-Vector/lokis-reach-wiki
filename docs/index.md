## Summary
This sector was formerly the home of {% include linker.mdf text="SA Military HQ" href="station/sam-hq" %} and the center of the {% include linker.mdf text="Star Alliance" href="faction/star-alliance" %} jurisdiction. When {% include linker.mdf text="The Rift" dir="event" %} annihilated the military base along with the systems around it, the {% include linker.mdf text="members" path="faction/star-alliance#members" %} of the alliance fragmented and an exodus began. {% include linker.mdf text="Loyal members" href="faction/star-alliance#remaining-members" %} attempted to salvage the alliance, but their efforts proved futile as the SA disintegrated over the following year.

## Sector Location
