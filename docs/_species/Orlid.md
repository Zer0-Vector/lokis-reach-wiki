The Orlids are xenomorphs and are known as excellent combatants, however due to their small stature, they cannot wield large melee weapons, rifles, or heavy weapons naturally. It is possible with some exertion, but as a primary weapon these are just impractical.

Orlids have a bulbous head, with a small mouth with small sharp teeth settled between two inset eyes. Their nostrils line the side of their chin. These small orifices are lined with fine hairs curling in as if to lead the scents into the nostril.

Slightly smaller than the average human, Orlids still have the five common extremities: two arms, two legs, and a neck. Their joints bend opposite to humans which is often unsettling to the uncultured onlooker.
