You were built as an android, a robot indistinguishable from a human without a medical-grade inspection. Most androids are “companion” bots, though other VIs with roles that involve significant human interaction may also be built as androids. Minor scuffs and cuts don’t reveal your robotic nature, but if reduced to zero hit points, your unnatural innards are obvious.
