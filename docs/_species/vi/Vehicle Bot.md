Some VIs were instantiated in actual vehicles rather than conventional humanoid bodies. Most were purely synthetic in origins, but some sectors retain the techniques for brain transplants into non-human bodies. Some polities have been known to conduct full-body cyberneticization of soldiers into tanks, warships, attack helicopters, and other military vehicles. As a vehicle, you are usually equipped with manipulator arms that can be used on adjacent objects. You may operate the individual elements of your vehicle as if they were your own limbs, attacking once per round with a mounted weapon of your choice.

''Level 1'': Gain Pilot as a bonus skill. Pick a vehicle acceptable to the GM, usually a drone, hoverbike or gravcar. You become that vehicle. You retain your usual attributes but gain the vehicle’s Armor score. You are Armor Class 10, modified by your Dexterity score. A tech can improve your Armor Class by aftermarket modifications, adding up to three times their Fix skill to your Armor Class at a cost of 1,000 credits per point of improvement.

You use the vehicle’s hit points until your own normally-rolled hit point score exceeds that number. Many VI vehicles purchase a drone or humanoid robot body to carry on board and employ for remote operation in areas unsuitable for a vehicle; you can pilot a single surrogate body in lieu of your own Main Action, provided there’s no ECM to jam the control transmissions.
