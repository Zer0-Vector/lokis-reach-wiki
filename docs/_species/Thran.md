A Thran's most noticeable feature is its slimy skin, usually a pale yellow color, but there are Thran who are shades of pale yellow-green and pale blue-green.

Thran are also have a unique way to manvouvre in their environment. The mucus membrane on the outer layer of skin helps with swimming and is a key component in the production of webbing from their fingertips. The webbing allows them to climb smooth surfaces.

The external membrane also assists in the detection of microgravity waves for detecting objects one might not otherwise be able to notice.
