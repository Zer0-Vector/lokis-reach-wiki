Every starship is equipped with two types sensors that can scan a specific target or the current [region of space|Regions](region of space|Regions), [*active*](#active-scan) sensors and [*passive*](#passive-scan) sensors.

When entering a new region of space, passive sensors will [scan](#passive-scan) for ships, {% include utils/linker.htmf text="stations" href=" space-stations" %}, or other relatively small objects (e.g. asteroids, debris, etc.). {% include utils/linker.htmf text="Stars" %}, {% include utils/linker.htmf text="planets" %}, {% include utils/linker.htmf text="moons" %}, {% include utils/linker.htmf text="asteroid belts" %}, and other relatively large objects are automatically detected. Objects in visual range are also automatically detected. To get more information about an object, an [active scan](#active-scan) must be done by the crew operating the {% include utils/linker.htmf text="comms" href="rules/starships/departments#comms" %}.

Detecting an object identifies the target's type (e.g. ship type(s), space station, etc.) and its energy signature, forming a [Detection Lock](#detection-lock). The lock lasts as long as the object remains in the {% include utils/linker.htmf text="region" href="rules/starships/travel#regions" %}.
