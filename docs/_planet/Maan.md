The [Zuwu](Zuwu) species native to Maan are evolved from cephalopoids that lived long ago before the ice age began. When the humans arrived in the second wave, they assimilated into the nomadic tribes that dwell here. They used advanced translator devices that could produce the sounds and color changes of the Tozuwu language. Decades after the Scream, the translators stopped working. Without them, the disconnect grew between the humans and the Zuwu.

The Maanians today live separate lives. The humans found shelter in the mountains where the churning weather systems could not reach. The [Zuwu](Zuwu) continued their nomadic, traversing the planet with the seasons.
